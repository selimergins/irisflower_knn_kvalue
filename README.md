# Selection of the Optimal k-value for Iris Type Recognition Algorithm with k-NN
This code script is written to visualize the decision boundaries and level of accuracy for each k-value between 1 and 8 and uses the Iris Flower Dataset from scikit-learn.
The train_test_split() function uses random_state= 42, so you can simulate the same example if you are willing to.
The script is written on Python 3.8.
